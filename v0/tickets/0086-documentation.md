# 0086: Documentation - Multi-Model Setup Guide

**Status**: DONE

- [x] Environment variable reference table is complete and accurate
- [x] Provider setup instructions cover all 5 providers
- [x] Model spec format is clearly explained with examples
- [x] Example configurations cover common use cases
- [x] Troubleshooting section addresses likely issues
- [x] All env var names match actual implementation
- [x] All provider URLs/endpoints are correct

## Dependencies

- All other epic tickets (0080-0085) - document final implementation

## Effort Estimate

Small: 1 hour

## Notes

- This should be written/finalized AFTER implementation is complete
- Keep examples practical and copy-pasteable
- Focus on "how to get started" rather than exhaustive reference
