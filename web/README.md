# Ei Online

I didn't intentionally make the two parts "Ei, Ei:O", but when I realized that I had, I certainly made no effort to avoid it.

Old MacDonald doesn't own vowels, OK?

Ei Online should be pretty straight-forward to start using, but there's actually a lot of features if you want to dig into them:

- Settings
    * You can click the Menu in the top-right, then open Settings
- Multi-Provider
    * In Settings, you can add multiple "Providers" - useful if you want a local model for some things, and remote LLMs for others
- Default Model
    * This will be what summaries are generated with, and what Personas will use
- My Data
    * You can click the Menu in the top-right, then open My Data
- Facts, Traits, People, and Topics
    * Your data is broken down into areas to help you manage it, and to help Personas understand it
- Add Personas
    * On the top-left, you can add new Personas
- Edit Personas
    * The list of persons on the left offer a Pencil button - use this to Edit the Persona
- Multi-line, Markdown messages
    * Just hold Shift while entering text to insert New-lines
    * Normal Markdown (and some HTML) work
